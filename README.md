# flights-with-pyspark
## Aim
The aim of this project is to utilise Pyspark Code that includes basics of using data frames and machine learning pipelines to analyse huge datasets.
## Summary
The task involves developing dataframes, pipelines and queries to extract and analyse data. Queries are made using SQL, integrated within PySpark. Sample datasets regarding flights and airports are provided for integration using PySpark.
## Guide
* 'pyspark_MLpipeline.ipynb' - Python code used to create the machine learning pipeline from PySpark's library. This uses a variety of machine learning methods such as One hot, logistic regression, etc.
* 'pyspark_dataframes.ipynb' - Python code to create and analyse dataframes for the airport, flights and planes datasets using PySpark syntax.
Datasets can be found within the 'Datasets' folder.
## Built With
* Python
* Spark
* SQL
## Note
There are some errors within the code. Further studies need to be done to fully integrate Python with Spark (e.g. turning datasets into PySpark tables).
